# Traffic Accident Data Analysis

Task-05 | Prodigy Infotech Internship Project

# Objective

-- The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize traffic accident data to uncover patterns based on:

-- Road conditions

-- Weather conditions

-- Time of day

-- The analysis helps in understanding accident hotspots and identifying contributing environmental factors. This version uses sample (mock) data without requiring a CSV file for ease of demonstration and testing.


# Overview

-- This project includes:

-- A bar chart showing accident counts across cities.

-- A pie chart visualizing distribution by road condition.

-- A bar chart showing weather-related accident trends.

-- A line chart depicting accidents based on time of day.

-- All visualizations are created using Python, with built-in sample data to avoid the need for dataset files.



# Technologies Used

-- Python

-- Pandas

-- Matplotlib

-- Seaborn



# Sample Data (Hardcoded)

-- The analysis uses a simulated dataset with fields:

-- City

-- Weather_Condition

-- Road_Condition

-- Time_of_Day

-- Accident_Count

-- This is ideal for showcasing visual analysis even without downloading external CSV files.


# Output Visualizations

1. Accident Count by City – Bar Plot

2. Accidents by Road Condition – Pie Chart

3. Accidents by Weather Condition – Bar Plot

4. Accidents by Time of Day – Line Chart


# Each visualization is generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn to clearly present accident trends.

📘 How to Use

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

2. Run all cells – no data upload is needed.

3. Visualize and interpret the graphs to understand accident patterns.
